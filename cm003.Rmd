Announcements:

- Homework has been released.
    - Public repo.
    - Need to have submitted the survey.
- New guidelines for [participation](http://stat545.com/Classroom/participation.html) assessment -- link is made available on the course syllabus.
- On my radar: asking for help from TA's in class!

Today's topics are:

1. Getting familiar with R
2. Intro to R Markdown

To participate in today's lecture, you should have:

- R and RStudio installed
- Optionally, LaTeX installed for outputting to pdf.
- A participation repo to put in-class work

# Getting Familiar with R

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, students are expected to be able to:

- Have a sense of the capabilities, and pros and cons, of R
- Write an R script to perform simple calculations
- Describe the main idea of vectorization
- Access the R documentation on an as-needed basis

## Resources:

- We'll be roughly following the [stat545.com: hello r](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html) page for exploring R.
- [adv-r: data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) is a more comprehensive version of exploring R objects. 
    - For those already experience with R: I recommend you look this chapter over. You'll probably learn something new.   
    - For those new to R, who want the depth, read until the end of the "Vectors" section.

Want to practice programming in R? Check out [R Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) for interactive lessons. 

## About R

Why R? Some points taken from [adv-r: intro](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html):

- Free, platform-wide
- Open source
- Comprehensive set of "add on" packages for analysis
- Huge community
- ...

Strengths that tend to be specific to R: 

- Naturally handles data (and therefore its analysis)
- Vectorization
- ..

Its downfalls?

- Slow
- To learners, seems "quirky" (due to reliance on "metaprogramming")
- S3 OO objects & methods not always transparent
- ...

Alternatives for data analysis?

- python is becoming more prominent in the data science community.
    - faster, more "all-purpose"
    - tends to handle text better
    - jupyter notebooks instead of RStudio and R Markdown

Methods for interacting with R (I'll demo basic calculations)

- Rstudio. __NOTE__: R is not RStudio! RStudio is an _IDE_. 
    - The STAT 545 (and largely the world's) choice!
- "R console"
- Terminal/ESS
- ...

## Demonstration

Set up shop to follow along:

1. Open RStudio.
2. Either:
    - Ideally, download and open the [template R script](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm003-exercise.R) (if you're online); OR
    - Start a new R Script. (File -> New File -> R Script)

To get participation marks for this activity:

1. Work with me as we fill in the worksheet.
    - Remember, you're not graded on correctness, just on the attempt!
2. Upload your worksheet to your STAT 545 participation repo.

The completed worksheet can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm003-exercise-complete.R).

# R Markdown

## Learning Objectives

- Create an R Markdown (Rmd) document and render it to md/html/pdf
- Write basic equations in Rmd using LaTeX
- Style an Rmd document by editing the YAML header
- Demonstrate at least two Rmd code chunk options
- Informatively choose between writing an R script/Rmd/R Notebook.

## Resources

Here are some resources that are well-aligned with today's goals:

- The [stat545: Rmd test drive](http://stat545.com/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html). Read this if you missed something from today's class.
- The [Rmd website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) has a fantastic walk-through [tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) that gives a great overview of R Markdown. The following lessons parallel today's content:
    - Lessons 1-4 (Intro - Inline Code)
    - Lessons 9-10 (Output Formats - Notebooks)

Here are resources that are great to reference:

- The official [Rmd cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) has seemingly everything bundled together in a concise way.
- An updated list of options for the YAML header can be found in the [rmd book: html-document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)

To dig deeper into any (?) aspect of R Markdown, check out the free [R Markdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) (also listed on the course syllabus).

## Getting Started

You'll need to install R Markdown. To do so, in any R console, run the following:

```
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

## Demonstration

Let's play with Rmd. No need to submit anything for participation marks! We'll do that next time when we explore data frames.

1. Create a new Rmd document: File -> New File -> R Markdown...
2. Title: "Data Frame Exploration".

- Notice the differences from regular markdown: YAML header, code chunks!

3. Save it -- I'll call it `cm003-exercise-df`.
4. Click `Knit`.
5. Try other outputs.
6. Try LaTeX equations.
7. Try inserting new chunks of code.
8. Try changing the theme with YAML.
9. Try changing chunk options.
10. Try making an R _Notebook_. 
    - R script/Rmd/R Notebook -- which to use?


# To do before next class

To participate in tomorrow's lecture, you should:

- Ensure you [follow the steps](http://stat545.com/Classroom/participation.html) to set up your "participation" repository.
- Complete the [course survey](https://goo.gl/forms/UPvRA6a9WRod8JPb2), if you haven't already.
    - You MUST do this in order to do your first assignment!
- You might want to try installing LaTeX, _if_ you want to be able to output to pdf and are not able to.
